                        <p class="text" id="about">Hello! I’m Kaitlyn, a sophomore based in Northern California. This is my 4th year at SOHS as a full-time student, and I’m running for Board Chair of Student Academic Support and services (SASS). 
                            My main interests revolve around math and programming, and I love anything related to art or design! I also love designing + coding websites, as you can probably tell from this one :D. </p>


                        <p class="text" id="experience"> Over the past few years, I’ve taken my fair share of OHS courses. I’ve also peer tutored quite a few of them (currently peer tutoring MSB, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus BC, and AP Computer Science A :D). In addition, I’ve been honored to work in SG before, where I created the first OHS Course Tips Event :), if you’ve heard of them. I hope to use the experience I’ve gained, coupled with the plans below, to help lighten your stress during the school year ;)</p>

                        <p class="text">I plan on continuing the current SASS blog, which includes articles about OHS courses as well as interviews of OHS instructors, peer tutors, and TAs</p> <br>
                        <p class="text">I’d also love to host more weekly study meetings (current plan is to have ≈ 2-3 consistently per week, and we can poll for the best time :D) where we can just chill and study together :). </p>

                            In addition to these current resources, I plan to expand the SASS website to include “information hubs” where we can share standardized testing (SAT/ACT/AP) sites, places to take classes at outside of OHS, transferring credit, etc. I spent way too much of my time researching information of the sort, so I hope that I’ll be able to at least partially relieve you of the same problems. </p>
